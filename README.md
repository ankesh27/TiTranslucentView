TiKBlurLive
===========

An attempt at making a Titanium module to provide a 'live' translucent/bluff effect for TiUIViews by wrapping ILTranslucentView.

Based on https://github.com/ivoleko/ILTranslucentView 


See the ExampleApp folder for tests.


Pleease do feel free to fork etc. and help fix this up. (I don't really know what I'm doing in Objective-C, but it seems to work!)
